## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to play at any time, anywhere.
* I want the site to be responsive to my device.
* I want the site to be easy to navigate.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

I want to be able to answer all the questions; if not, I can learn from my failures because the correct answer will be shown if I choose the incorrect one.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to log my high scores to see how I am performing.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I aimed to maintain the color scheme in blue to match the background image, which is predominantly blue. I chose white for the text color to ensure readability. Additionally, green and red were selected as answer colors.

* I have used `#102747` & `linear-gradient(#00050d, #3866a6)` as the primary and secondary colours used for the buttons, modal and footer background.
* I have used `#000000cc` as the overlay used over the sites background image.
* I have used `#800e32` to display the incorrect answers.
* I have used `#055d2c` to display the correct answers.
* I have used `##0D1C33` as the hovercolor for the buttons.
* I have used `#f0f8ff` for the text.

### Typography

Google-webfonts-helper was used to import the chosen font for use in the site.

* For the game I have used the google font [Lato](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts/lato?subsets=latin).

![Lato sans-serif Font Example](documentation/images/lato-font.png)

I've chosen Lato sans-serif font for its clean lines, enhancing readability on screens. Its sleek design not only ensures a pleasant reading experience but also aligns well with the aesthetics of programming languages.


### Imagery

As the website is called JS-Quiz, I wanted to use an image for the page background of an abstract  digital background with a texture resembling technology circuit boards. Abstract backgrounds can add visual interest and attractiveness to the game, making it more engaging for players.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Home Page](documentation/wireframes/home-page-wireframes.png)
![Instruction Page](documentation/wireframes/instruction-page-wireframe.png)

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page and an instruction page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

  ![favicon](documentation/features/favicon.png)
  ![https://de.vecteezy.com/](https://de.vecteezy.com/vektorkunst/21287803-javascript-datei-vektor-icon-design)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.
  ![Javascript-Quiz Title](documentation/features/title.png)


#### The Home Page

The home page ...

![Home page image](documentation/features/home-page.png)

The how to play  button opens a page showing the user how to play the game. The page contains a close button which will close the page, and show the home page again.

![instruction page image](documentation/features/instruction-page.png)

At the outset, the player is prompted to enter their name in a modal window. Once the name is entered, the modal form disappears, initiating the start of the game.

![Modal open image](documentation/features/modal1.png)

At the end, another modal appears displaying a congratulatory message indicating that the player has won, along with the player's total score.

![End of game](documentation/features/modal2.png)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Integrate with Learning Platforms: Partner with educational platforms or institutions to integrate the quiz game into their curriculum or learning management systems, offering a supplementary tool for students to reinforce their knowledge of JavaScript.
2. Expand beyond quizzes and incorporate interactive tutorials or coding challenges to provide hands-on learning experiences for users to practice JavaScript concepts in a practical setting.


### Accessibility


* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Ensuring that everything is readeble.

## Credits

### Code Used

I learned the JavaScript essentials from the Code Institute content.

* I used [this You Tube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAB_v6yBXIE&t=503s) and this page [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp)to learn how to create a modal dialog for the beginning and the end of the game.

* For the questions I used the following page [This Math(.random)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) to further adapt the shuffle I had researched on W3Schools to work with the data I had.

* I learned various methods for working with arrays from this specified page: [Array Methods](https://javascript.info/array-methods)

* I used this Tutorial from CodeInstitute [JavaScript debugging tutor session](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AE87BqXYPmvvP910Kiz17DcKQUvDSGWZ/view)https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AE87BqXYPmvvP910Kiz17DcKQUvDSGWZ/view

* - I used [Kera Cudmore's Quiz Arms Readme](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms/blob/main/README.md) as an inspiration for my project's Readme.


### Content
